## carbon
A light implementation of carbon design system in Go.


### about
The lack of complete and clear Go libraries for a graphical user interface encouraged me to a create this one. It bases on [pixel](https://github.com/faiface/pixel) OpenGL library. This is not full-featured framework, so it is not a perfect solution if you want to quickly develop a modern beautiful app. This package is inspired by [Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/), due to its easyness to implement. But as it hasn't got complete components, it has all necessary tools to create them on fly.
